OpenStack Swift
===============

Swift is a distributed object storage system designed to scale from a single machine to thousands of servers.

Production ready?
Beta

This API is new to jclouds and hence is in Beta. That means we need people to use it and give us feedback. Based on that feedback, minor changes to the interfaces may happen. This code will replace org.jclouds.openstack.swift.SwiftClient in jclouds 2.0 and it is recommended you adopt it sooner than later.
